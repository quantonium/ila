Experimental code for Path MTU HBH option. This used a UDP ping program
that adds the MTU option at the client, reflects it at the server and
reports the option as received.

Usage (must be priveleged user to set HBH options):

Server:

    ./udp_ping_server

Client:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="~/quantonium/ila/src/lib/fast"
	./udp_ping [-v] [-M <num_opts> ] dest_addr


   -v : Verbose output (print option data)
   -M <num_opts>: Number of options to put in a packet
